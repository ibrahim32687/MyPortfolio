      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
       i ’m a passionate and dedicated programmer who thrives on solving complex problems and building practical, user-friendly solutions through code. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy turning ideas into real, working applications that are not only functional but also cleanly designed and efficient.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects — from small websites to full-scale web applications — and each one has taught me something new about collaboration, persistence, and the power of technology. I’m deeply committed to continuous learning, always exploring new frameworks, languages, and tools that can help me write better, smarter code.

Whether I’m optimizing a database, crafting responsive interfaces, or debugging tricky issues late into the night, I bring a mix of technical skill, creative thinking, and a love for the craft of software development. My goal isn’t just to write code, but to write impactful code — the kind that improves user experiences, solves real-world problems, and stands the test of time.
